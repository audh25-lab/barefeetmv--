# Barefeet.mv 👣

**Barefeet.mv** is a world-first, breath-driven puzzle engine inspired by *Threes* —
reinvented from first principles around intuition, flow, and embodied interaction.

## 🧠 Core Ideas

- **Ripple Weaves** — tiles are living energy threads, not static blocks
- **Breath Gestures**
  - Inhale → contract space
  - Exhale → expand space
  - Pinch → ripple-combine
- **Echo Presence** — 👣 imprints show flow memory
- **Realm Evolution** — grid morphs, gravity tilts, time dilates
- **Eternal Weave** — infinite mode with persistent high score
